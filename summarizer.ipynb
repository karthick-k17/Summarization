      "## 2024 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "This report, the 17th edition, analyzes 30,458 security incidents, a record high, including 10,626 confirmed data breaches across 94 countries. It delves deeper into breach pathways to identify the most likely actions and vectors leading to breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Findings:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Exploitation of vulnerabilities is on the rise:** Almost tripled from last year, driven by Ransomware and Extortion actors targeting Web applications. MOVEit vulnerability had a significant impact.\n",
      "* **Ransomware and Extortion dominate:** Combined, they account for 32% of breaches, with Ransomware prevalent across 92% of industries.\n",
      "* **Human element remains a factor:** It is a component of 68% of breaches, highlighting the importance of security awareness training.\n",
      "* **Third-party involvement is growing:** Increased 68% from last year, fueled by zero-day exploits and software supply chain issues.\n",
      "* **Errors are more prevalent than previously thought:** Increased to 28% due to expanded contributor base.\n",
      "* **Internal actors play a larger role:** Increased to 35% of breaches, primarily due to Miscellaneous Errors.\n",
      "* **Financial motive remains dominant:** Espionage motive saw a slight increase to 7%, concentrated in Public Administration breaches.\n",
      "* **GenAI impact is still unclear:** While there is interest in using GenAI for attacks, its actual impact remains minimal.\n",
      "* **Vulnerability management needs improvement:** It takes around 55 days to remediate 50% of critical vulnerabilities in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.\n",
      "* **Secure by design is crucial:** Organizations should prioritize vendors who focus on security by design to reduce vulnerabilities.\n",
      "* **Pretexting surpasses Phishing:** Pretexting, especially Business Email Compromise (BEC), accounts for one-fourth of financially motivated attacks.\n",
      "* **Ransomware remains a top threat:** Median adjusted loss for those who pay is $46,000, with ransom demands averaging 1.34% of victim revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Incident Classification Patterns:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **System Intrusion:** Remains the top pattern, driven by Ransomware and exploitation of vulnerabilities.\n",
      "* **Social Engineering:** Pretexting is the leading cause of incidents, with a significant increase in Extortion due to MOVEit.\n",
      "* **Basic Web Application Attacks:** Experienced a significant decline from last year, but still a prevalent attack vector.\n",
      "* **Miscellaneous Errors:** Increased significantly, primarily due to Misdelivery.\n",
      "* **Denial of Service:** Remains the most prevalent incident type, with both high-volume and low-volume attacks on the rise.\n",
      "* **Lost and Stolen Assets:**  Devices are more likely to be lost than stolen, with laptops being a significant risk.\n",
      "* **Privilege Misuse:**  Employee betrayal remains a threat, with Financial motive being the most common.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Regional Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **EMEA:**  Experienced a surge in Miscellaneous Errors due to expanded contributor base.\n",
      "* **APAC:**  Espionage motive is higher than other regions, with Internal accounts and Secrets being the most compromised data types.\n",
      "* **NA:**  Social Engineering is on the rise, driven by Extortion.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Prioritize vulnerability management:** Patch critical vulnerabilities quickly, especially those in the CISA KEV catalog.\n",
      "* **Focus on secure by design:** Choose vendors who prioritize security in their products and services.\n",
      "* **Improve security awareness:** Train employees on how to identify and report phishing attacks, and handle ransom demands.\n",
      "* **Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA):**  Mitigate the risk of stolen credentials.\n",
      "* **Strengthen third-party security:**  Vet vendors carefully and ensure they have strong security practices.\n",
      "* **Invest in DDoS protection:**  Prepare for Denial of Service attacks.\n",
      "* **Protect sensitive data:** Encrypt data at rest and in transit.\n",
      "* **Develop strong incident response plans:**  Ensure you have a plan in place to respond to breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report emphasizes the importance of collaboration between organizations, law enforcement, and technology companies to combat cybercrime effectively. It also highlights the need for continuous improvement in security practices and the adoption of secure by design principles. \n",

The graph shows that credentials were the most common way-in, with almost 40% of breaches occurring through this method. Phishing and exploit vulnerabilities were the next most common ways-in, with around 20% and 10% of breaches occurring through these methods, respectively.\n",

      "The second graph shows the trend of ransomware and extortion breaches over time. The graph shows that ransomware and extortion breaches have been on the rise in recent years. In 2024, ransomware and extortion breaches combined accounted for 23% of all breaches. Ransomware was a top threat across 92% of industries.\n",

      "The text accompanying the graphs provides further context and insights. It notes that the analysis witnessed a substantial growth in attacks involving the exploitation of vulnerabilities as the critical path to initiate a breach when compared to previous years. The growth in these attacks is attributed to the effect of MOVEIT and similar zero-day vulnerabilities. The text also notes that ransomware and extortion-related threats were primarily leveraged by ransomware actors. Web applications were the main vector for these initial entry points. \n",
